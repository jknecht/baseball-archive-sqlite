SQLite Baseball Archive
=======================
Thanks to the generous work of [Sean Lahman](https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics), baseball geeks everywhere can 
analyze and play with baseball stats dating all the way back to 1871.
Unfortunately, this data is only published in MS Access or as a collection
of comma-delimited files.  For those of us who want to use a relational
database but can't install MS Access, we have to resort to other alternatives.

The fine folks over at baseball-databank.org convert this data to MySQL
each year.  But again, there are those of us who prefer the simplicity
of a file-based database rather than running a server.

So, here I present to you the Sean Lahman baseball database in SQLite format.
